## ⚙️ Google OAuth2 Configuration
To enable Google Login:
1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create an **OAuth 2.0 Client ID** (Web Application).
3. Set the **Authorized Redirect URI** to:
   `http://localhost:8092/login/oauth2/code/google`
4. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

## 🏃 How to Run

### 1. Backend Setup
1. Create your local configuration file:
   ```powershell
   cd backend/src/main/resources
   cp application.yml.example application.yml
   ```
2. Open **`application.yml`** and fill in your real credentials:
   - **MongoDB URI**: Your connection string (with username/password).
   - **Google OAuth**: Your Client ID and Secret.
   - **JWT Secret**: Any secure, random string.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Security First**: The `application.yml` file is already added to `.gitignore`. Your real secrets will **never** be committed to your repository. Only `application.yml.example` is shared.

3. Run the backend:
   ```powershell
   cd backend
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
   *Server starts on port **8092**.*

### 2. Frontend Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```
2. Check your [src/config.js](file:///c:/Users/kevin/Downloads/Facility-Flow/frontend/src/config.js) to ensure it points to port `8092`.
3. Start the application:
   ```powershell
   npm start
   ```
   *Dashboard launches on port **3000**.*
